# Arcade AI Interview Challenge

Welcome to the Arcade AI Interview Challenge! This project tests your ability to work with AI multimodal APIs, and be creative with your problem solving

## üéØ Challenge Overview

You've been provided with a `flow.json` file that contains data from an Arcade flow recording. Your task is to build a script that analyzes this flow data and creates a comprehensive report.

## üìã Requirements

Your application should accomplish the following:

1. **Identify User Interactions**: List out the actions the user did in a human readable format (i.e. "Clicked on checkout", "Search for X")
2. **Generate Human-Friendly Summary**: Create a clear, readable summary of what the user was trying to accomplish
3. **Create a Social Media Image**: Generate an creative image suitable for sharing on social platforms that represents the flow and would drive engagement

These items should be then displayed in a **markdown file** that can be committed in your project

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Requirements

- **Language**: Any
- **AI Integration**: You will be provided an OpenAI API key, but feel free to use providers you have accounts with
- **Version Control**: Use GitHub/Bitbucket to track your work - we want to see your development process and commit history

## üîí Security Note

**IMPORTANT**: Never commit your API key to version control! Use environment variables or a `.env` file (and add it to `.gitignore`) to keep your API key secure.

## üìÅ Project Structure

You'll be provided with:
- `flow.json` - The flow data to analyze
- OpenAI API key 


Your application should generate:
- A comprehensive markdown report
- A social media image file

## üé® Arcade Flow Reference

The flow data comes from this Arcade recording: https://app.arcade.software/share/2RnSqfsV4EsODmUiPKoW

You can view the original flow to understand what the user was doing, your solution should be general purpose enough to work for most Arcade flows.

## üí° Hints

- The `flow.json` contains different types of steps (IMAGE, CHAPTER, VIDEO, etc.)
- Each step has metadata about what the user clicked and when
- Think about how to structure your analysis for maximum clarity
- The social media image should be professional and represent the flow's purpose
- Feel free to use different models types to both understand the flow and generate the image

## Sample Output

### Summary
```
